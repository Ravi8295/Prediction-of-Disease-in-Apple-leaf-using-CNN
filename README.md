# Prediction-of-Disease-in-Apple-leaf-using-CNN
Apple tree diseases can significantly impact fruit quality and yield, making early detection and intervention crucial for orchard management. To avoid the impact on apple production a novel approach is required for the early and accurate prediction of diseases in apple leaves using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Our proposed system contains a comprehensive dataset of high-resolution images of apple leaves exhibiting various disease symptoms, including common issues like apple scab, apple rust, and powdery mildew. The dataset was carefully annotated to train and validate the CNN model effectively. The proposed CNN model utilizes its ability to automatically learn relevant features from images, making it highly suitable for the task of disease prediction in apple leaves.This model contribute to the field of precision agriculture by offering a cost effective and efficient tool for apple disease detection.
